All source files are located in the vs-2019 folder.
All sprites are still located in sprites folder, and all sounds in the sounds folder.
This was developed for Windows 10 in Visual Studio 2019, so the makefile wasn't used.

To run, load the solution into Visual Studio 2019 and run on platform x64, in Debug.
