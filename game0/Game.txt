Additional Things added:

Health for hero: health starts at 50 and is decreased by 10 every time a saucer hits the hero.
If health reaches 0 then game over is triggered and your ship blows up.

Health display: health is displayed at the top and updates every time the hero gains or loses health.

HealthPack: spawns when hero's health is 30 or below; only 1 is spawned for each loss of 10 health points.
If player collects the healthpack, health increases by 10.

HealthPack sprite: basic sprite for the health pack with simple animation

Added in health pickup sound and in-game music - both are located in the sounds folder.

Made some minor changes to some object velocities and colors.

The code for the healthpack involved creating a health event for the game to watch for that was 
triggered whenever a healthpack collided with the hero, as well as handling collisions between
the healthpack and the ship, and the healthpack and saucers. Eventually I made it so the healthpack
had a SOFT solidness so it wouldn't interfere with saucer movements but could still be collected by
the player. Also created were the healthpack source files, health attribute in hero, and the health
display viewObject source files.
